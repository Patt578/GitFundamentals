# git config
 
When first setting up git, you'll need to work with the git config commands in order to setup your identity.

For example, your identity can be set up with commands such as:

git config --global user.name "Patt578"
git config --global user.email bassettptty@gmail.com

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
